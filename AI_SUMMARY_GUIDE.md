## Example Summary

```
**Overall Assessment**
John demonstrates excellent alignment with the Senior Software Engineer position, 
achieving an 85% overall match score. His strong technical skills (92% skill match) 
and relevant experience make him a highly competitive candidate for this role.

**Strengths**
• Strong technical foundation with Python, JavaScript, React, and AWS (92% skill match)
• Relevant experience in full-stack development and team leadership
• Demonstrated CI/CD implementation and microservices architecture experience
